// The name of a function depends on both the return type and the semantic meaning of the returned value

// For bools
// E.g. Avoid checkValid() and to isValid() instead
    // isValid() makes it very clear that true = valid and false = not vlaid, whilst checkValid() does not necessarily imply that true = valid and false = not valid



// Static variables:
    // Any magic numbers should be a static variable
        // I.e. Any number that is used in multiple places independently, that do not depend on the instance of an object. 


// Static functions:
    // Any functions that do not rely on internal state should largely be static  
        // This is also valuable from a readability perspective. 

// Never use multiple sprite batches


// Todo:
    // Add a start button
    // Add a restart + finals score button
